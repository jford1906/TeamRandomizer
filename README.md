# TeamRandomizer
A quick way to make random teams for students in a classroom

Download the python file in the same directory as a csv file containing the student names. The first column should be the first names, and the second column the last names of the students.

If you are using a class list in Moodle, the csv export of class grades is already correctly formatted.

You can edit the number of teams, the name of the roster file, and the name of the output file before running the program.
